Sierra Mountain Little League (SMLL) is part of [Little League
District 10](https://www.cadistrict10.com){:target="_blank"}
in central California.

We have been serving the mountain communities of the Sierra foothills
for over 30 years, providing baseball and softball activities for coed
players from 4-13. Our areas of coverage include the towns of
Ahwahnee, Bass Lake, Fish Camp, North Fork, and Oakhurst.

Our purpose is to implant the ideas of sportsmanship, honesty, loyalty,
courage, and respect for leadership into our youth.

Sierra Mountain Little League takes pride in their coaches, players,
parents, and umpires volunteering dozens of hours to our youth.
We also thank each and every one of the sponsors that we support us
each year. We cannot survive without you all!

If you would to become a volunteer or would like to donate to our
league, please [email us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/)!
