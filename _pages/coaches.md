All of our coaches are volunteers. We have many that come back year
after year to lead our kids, but we will always welcome new coaches
and we need many to volunteer each year. First-time parent volunters
and leaders with experience at other organizations will all have something
valuable to contribute.

If you're interested, please [reach out]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/)
to our Coaching Coordinator and see the [Volunteer]({{ site.baseurl }}/volunteers)
page for registration info.


## What do I need to be a coach?

At least one coach or manager from each team must attend a first aid class and
a baseball training session, both provided by the league at the beginning of the
season. The training will cover coaching fundamentals, including pitching,
hitting, sliding, and fielding, at levels appropriate for the ages you'll
be coaching.

See Little League's [Appointing Managers, Coaches, and Umpires
](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/appointing-managers-coaches-and-umpires/).

Skills and health training is covered at Little League's [Incorporating
Effective Local Training Can Prep Volunteers for a Safer, More Successful
Season](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/incorporating-effective-local-training-can-prep-volunteers-for-a-safer-more-successful-season/).

## Things to Know

### Player Age

You may get questions from parents when they're signing up their kids, wanting to know
what they should register for. We accommodate boys and girls 4-13 in baseball,
girls 9-12 in softball, and 4-18 in our Challenger baseball division.

Please see the [League Age &amp; Divisions]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/01/18/league-age/)
post for an overview of how divisions and ages work.

### Rule Highlights

Little League highlights common misconceptions:
* for coaches: [10 Commonly Misinterpreted Little League®
  Rules](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/10-commonly-misinterpreted-little-league-rules/).
* for parents: [Common Little League® Rule Misconceptions: What Parents Need to
Know](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/common-little-league-rule-misconceptions-what-parents-need-to-know/)

The sections below highlight our local "ground rules", where we call out
the special circumstances related to our facilities and describe the
approved divergences and intepretations of Little League's official rules.

#### SMLL Field Rules

_Forthcoming_

#### Coaches During Games

Only 3 coaches per team are allowed on the field during games, which includes 2
base coaches and 1 adult who must supervise the dugout while the team is at bat.

People can't just freely exchange roles during a game. A person outside the
field must stay outside the field, and a person on the field must fulfill all
the roles of a team coach throughout.

Coaches, consider arranging with a team parent to assist with off-field needs
during the game. It can be _very_ helpful to have someone to find that player
who took too long on a bathroom break, to fetch a drink for the player getting
dehydrated, or to re-supply your hungry players from the snack shed.

#### Stealing Bases

_(Forthcoming)_

#### Game Times, Lead Limits, Mercy Rules

_(Forthcoming)_

#### Pitching Limits

Pitchers in every division have limits on the number of pitches they can
throw in a game, how many days of rest they need afterward, and when they
can switch between catcher and pitcher. See [our pitch counts](#pitch-counts)
section for details.

#### Substitutions

### Player Safety

Ways to help keep your team safe include:
* keeping a [first aid kit](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/first-aid-kits-an-items-list/){:target="_blank"} handy
* knowing health essentials (see below)
* [tracking in-game throws by your pitchers](#pitch-counts) 
* correct use and maintenance of catching gear
* knowing local field safety guidance
* following league safety rules

A variety of health and safety fundamentals are available online.  For an
overview, see Little League's [The Safest Little League® Experience Comes
from Doing Common Tasks](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/the-safest-little-league-experience-comes-from-doing-common-tasks/).

Print out a copy of this [Concussion Recognition
Tool]({{ site.urls.files }}/concussion-field-guide.pdf).
Familiarize yourself with it and keep it with your field bag or clipboard.
You'll have it available if one of your players has any sign of a head injury.

concussion awareness in youth sports, see Little League's [Concussions in Youth
Athletes](https://www.littleleague.org/player-safety/concussions-youth-athletes/).

from the NFHS.

Heat-related ilness is a real risk here in central California. Take a look at the
Little League Rulebook's [Appendix E -- Heat Illness Prevention Protection
Policy](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/appendices/appendix-e/)
and US Soccer's [Recognize to Recover Heat
Guidelines]({{ site.urls.files }}/recognize-to-recover-heat-guidlines.pdf).

### Pitch Counts

Players of all ages may only throw a limited number of pitches per
day and keeping track of this is an essential part of keeping your
players healthy. The scorekeepers usually track it during games,
but it's helpful, as a coach, to keep track of your players' limits
so that you can manage your pitching roster and substitutions
effectively.

  Rules](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/pitch-count/)

  Baseball®?](https://www.littleleague.org/help-center/little-league-baseball-pitch-counts/)

### Coaching Bases

At every game, your team will need coaches on 1st and 3rd base.

Little League has a great article on [Coaching
Bases](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/coaching-the-bases-101/)
that gives some introductory tips.


## FAQ

### _What if I can't make all the games?_

An assistant coach or a team parent can cover practices and games
if the head coach can't make it. Don't let that hold you back from
signing up as a coach!

### _Are there team pictures?_

The league provides team photos as part of the registration fee.
They're typically taken near the end of the season, in April or May.
Keep an eye on the [News]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/) page for an announcement.

### _When and where can I practice?_

All practices are held at the [league's fields]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/#fields)
behind the Oakhurst Community Center. Board members will reach out to coaches
at the beginning of the season to coordinate practice times for each division.

Minors field:
* Tee ball
* Player and Coach Pitch
* Minors
* AAA
* Softball

Majors field:
* AAA
* Majors
* 50/70

### _Can I borrow players for a game?_

Yes and no. Players cannot be loaned and borrowed directly between
coaches. The process must be coordinated through the league's
[Player Agent]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/), where available players
are part of a pool and assigned as needed by the agent.
See Little League's [What is a Player
Pool](https://www.littleleague.org/help-center/what-is-a-player-pool/).

Please note that pool players may not pitch in games with their
temporary teams. They must be used to play for 9 consecutive defensive
outs and bat once.

See [Little League® Significant Rule and Regulation Updates for
2021]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/2021-rulebook-significant-changes.pdf),
under "Regulation V(c)" for more information.

### _Can a coach warm up pitchers or catchers?_

You sure can! This was prohibited until recently, but changes for 2023
include this update:

> **Rule 3.09:**
>
> _This would aid in efforts to improve the pace of play by allowing
> adult coaches to warm up pitchers for regular season only._
> 
> Managers or coaches ~~must not~~ **are permitted** to warm up a pitcher
> at home plate or in the bullpen or elsewhere at any time including
> in-game warm-up, pre-game warm-up, and in other instances. They may
> also stand by to observe a pitcher during warm-up in the bullpen.

See [Little League® Significant Rule and Regulation Updates for
2023]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/2023-rulebook-significant-changes.pdf).

### _Can youth play on more than one team or in more multiple divisions?_

Yes. Please [reach out]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) to the league Player Agent
with questions about this.
