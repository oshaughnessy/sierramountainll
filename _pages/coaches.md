All of our coaches are volunteers. We have many that come back year
after year to lead our kids, but we will always welcome new coaches
as well. First-time parent volunters and leaders with experience at
other organizations will all have something valuable to contribute.

If you're interested, please [reach out]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/), then see the
[Registration](#registration) section below.


## Registration

If you'd like to coach a team, please register for the Manager or Assistant Coach
position after signing up your player(s).

1. **Register** as a coach at [Sports Connect](https://login.stacksports.com/login?client_id=612b0399b1854a002e427f78&redirect_uri=https://core-api.bluesombrero.com/login/redirect/portal/7479&app_name=Sierra+Mountain+Little+League&portalid=7479&instancekey=sports)

    After you've registered your players for the season, you'll be offered
	options for volunteer. Team Manager and Assistant Coach are both ways
	you can contribute to the running of a team.

2. [Complete **coaching courses**](#coaching-requirements). 

   _TBD: required?_

3. You'll also need to submit a form for a [**background check**](#background-checks).

   _TBD: required?_

   See https://www.littleleague.org/player-safety/child-protection-program/local-league-background-check-information/.
   _TBD: describe JDP/Sports Connect Integration_

4. [Register a **Live Scan**](#live-scan). This only needs to be done once by each league
   coach and does not need to be done annuarlly. A Live Scan for another organization
   cannot be used by SMLL.

**Please Note**:
For registrations, it is essential that you use your full legal name. The system that
processes your Live Scan application will only be able to connect your information
to our registration system if they all have the same name. The Live Scan application
runs through the California Department of Justice, where it will need to match your
registered legal name.

### Player Safety

Ways to keep your team safe include:
* following league safety rules
* keeping a first aid kit handy
* tracking pitch counts
* correct use and maintenance of catching gear
* knowing local field safety guidance

For an overview guide, see Little League's [The Safest Little League® Experience Comes
from Doing Common Tasks](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/the-safest-little-league-experience-comes-from-doing-common-tasks/).

See Little League's [first aid kit
guide](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/first-aid-kits-an-items-list/).

In addition, [tracking pitch counts](#pitch-counts) is a critical part of protecting your
pitchers.

Learn about **concussion** symptoms and how to deal with potential head injuries.
Print out a copy of this [Concussion Recognition
Tool]({{ site.urls.files }}/concussion-field-guide.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
Familiarize yourself with it and keep it with your field bag or clipboard.
You'll have it available if one of your players has any sign of a head injury.
For more information, including references for California's state laws regarding
concussion awareness in youth sports, see Little League's [Concussions in Youth
Athletes](https://www.littleleague.org/player-safety/concussions-youth-athletes/){:target="_blank"}.

Heat-related ilness is a real risk here in central California. Take a look at the
Little League Rulebook's [Appendix E -- Heat Illness Prevention Protection
Policy](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/appendices/appendix-e/){:target="_blank"}
and US Soccer's [Recognize to Recover Heat
Guidelines]({{ site.urls.files }}/recognize-to-recover-heat-guidlines.pdf){:target="_blank"}

### Pitch Counts

Players of all ages may only throw a limited number of pitches per day and keeping track
of this is an essential part of keeping your players healthy. The scorekeepers usually
track it during games, but it's helpful, as a coach, to keep track of your players' limits
so that you can manage your pitching roster and substitutions effectively.

| Age Range | Pitch Limit Per Day |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 7-8 	    | 50                  |
| 9-10 	    | 75                  |
| 11-12     | 85                  |
| 13-16     | 95                  |
