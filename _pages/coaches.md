All of our coaches are volunteers. We have many that come back year
after year to lead our kids, but we will always welcome new coaches
as well. First-time parent volunters and leaders with experience at
other organizations will all have something valuable to contribute.

If you're interested, please [reach out]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/), then see the
[Registration](#registration) section below.


## Registration

If you'd like to coach a team, please register for the Manager or Assistant Coach
position after signing up your player(s).

1. **Register** as a coach at [Sports Connect](https://login.stacksports.com/login?client_id=612b0399b1854a002e427f78&redirect_uri=https://core-api.bluesombrero.com/login/redirect/portal/7479&app_name=Sierra+Mountain+Little+League&portalid=7479&instancekey=sports)

    After you've registered your players for the season, you'll be offered
	options for volunteer. Team Manager and Assistant Coach are both ways
	you can contribute to the running of a team.

2. [Complete **coaching courses**](#coaching-requirements). 

   _TBD: required?_

3. You'll also need to submit a form for a [**background check**](#background-checks).

   _TBD: required?_

   See https://www.littleleague.org/player-safety/child-protection-program/local-league-background-check-information/.
   _TBD: describe JDP/Sports Connect Integration_

4. [Register a **Live Scan**](#live-scan). This only needs to be done once by each league
   coach and does not need to be done annuarlly. A Live Scan for another organization
   cannot be used by SMLL.

**Please Note**:
For registrations, it is essential that you use your full legal name. The system that
processes your Live Scan application will only be able to connect your information
to our registration system if they all have the same name. The Live Scan application
runs through the California Department of Justice, where it will need to match your
registered legal name.

### Player Safety

Learn about **concussion** symptoms and how to deal with potential head injuries.
Print out a copy of this [Concussion Recognition
Tool]({{ site.urls.files }}/concussion-field-guide.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
Familiarize yourself with it and keep it with your field bag or clipboard.
You'll have it available if one of your players has any sign of a head injury.
For more information, including references for California's state laws regarding
concussion awareness in youth sports, see Little League's [Concussions in Youth
Athletes](https://www.littleleague.org/player-safety/concussions-youth-athletes/){:target="_blank"}.

Heat-related ilness is a real risk here in central California. Take a look at the
Little League Rulebook's [Appendix E -- Heat Illness Prevention Protection
Policy](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/appendices/appendix-e/){:target="_blank"}
and US Soccer's [Recognize to Recover Heat
Guidelines]({{ site.urls.files }}/recognize-to-recover-heat-guidlines.pdf){:target="_blank"}

### Player Age

You may get questions from parents when they're signing up their kids, wanting to know
what they should register for. We accommodate boys and girls 4-13 in baseball,
girls 9-12 in softball, and 4-18 in our Challenger baseball division.

Please see the [League Age &amp; Divisions]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/01/18/league-age/)

## FAQ

### _What if I can't make all the games?_

An assistant coach or a team parent can cover practices and games
if the head coach can't make it. Don't let that hold you back from
signing up as a coach!

### _Are there team pictures?_

The league provides team photos as part of the registration fee.
They're typically taken near the end of the season, in April or May.
Keep an eye on the [News]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/) page for an announcement.

### _When and where can I practice?_

All practices are held at the [league's fields]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/#fields)

at the beginning of the season to coordinate practice times for each division.
