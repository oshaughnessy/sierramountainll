All of our coaches are volunteers. We have many that come back year
after year to lead our kids, but we will always welcome new coaches
and we need many to volunteer each year. First-time parent volunters
and leaders with experience at other organizations will all have something
valuable to contribute.

If you're interested, please [reach out]({% link _pages/contact.md %})
to our Coaching Coordinator and see the [Roles]({% link _pages/roles.md %})
page for registration info.


## What do I need to be a coach?

At least one coach or manager from each team must attend a first aid class and
a baseball training session, both provided by the league at the beginning of the
season. The training will cover coaching fundamentals, including pitching,
hitting, sliding, and fielding, at levels appropriate for the ages you'll
be coaching.

Please see our [Volunteers]({% link _pages/volunteers.md %}) page for info
on background checks and other requirements mandated by California and Little League.

](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/appointing-managers-coaches-and-umpires/).

## Things to Know

### Player Age

You may get questions from parents when they're signing up their kids, wanting to know
what they should register for. We accommodate boys and girls 4-13 in baseball,
girls 9-12 in softball, and 4-22 in our Challenger baseball division.

Please see the [League Age &amp; Divisions]({% post_url 2023-01-18-league-age %})
post for an overview of how divisions and ages work.

### Rule Highlights

Please see our [Rules page]({% link _pages/rules.md %}) for SMLL's local ground rules
and highlights of League rules.

## Responsibilities

Coaches take on a handful of roles that are often shared by the team manager.
We cover the list on our [roles]({{ site.baseurl }}/roles/#coach--assistant-coach)
page. A few key roles are outlined below.

### Player Safety

Ways to help keep your team safe include:
* keeping a [first aid kit](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/first-aid-kits-an-items-list/){:target="_blank"} handy
* knowing health essentials (see below)
* [tracking in-game throws by your pitchers]({{ site.baseurl }}/rules/#pitch-counts) 
* correct use and maintenance of catching gear
* knowing local field safety guidance
* following league safety rules

Little League has a great coach's field checklist at [The Safest Little League® Experience Comes
from Doing Common Tasks](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/the-safest-little-league-experience-comes-from-doing-common-tasks/).

Print out a copy of this [Concussion Recognition
Tool]({% link /assets/files/concussion-field-guide.pdf %}).
Familiarize yourself with it and keep it with your field bag or clipboard.
You'll have it available if one of your players has any sign of a head injury.

For more information, including references for California's state laws regarding
concussion awareness in youth sports, see Little League's [Concussions in Youth
Athletes](https://www.littleleague.org/player-safety/concussions-youth-athletes/).
A [free concussion training course is available](https://nfhslearn.com/courses/concussion-in-sports-2)
from the NFHS.

Heat-related illness is a real risk here in central California. Take a look at the
Little League Rulebook's [Appendix E -- Heat Illness Prevention Protection
Policy](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/appendices/appendix-e/)
and US Soccer's [Recognize to Recover Heat
Guidelines]({% link /assets/files/recognize-to-recover-heat-guidlines.pdf %}).

### Concussion Awareness Requirements

All coaches at SMLL need to read this [CDC concussion information
sheet]({% link /assets/files/headsup-coaches.pdf %}){:target="_blank"}
for coaches, sign it at the beginning of each season, and return it
to the league safety officer.

For more, please see the CDC's HEADS UP to Youth Sports [for
coaches](https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/youthsports/coach.html).


### Sudden Cardiac Arrest Requirements

All coaches at SMLL should read this [sudden cardiac arrest information
sheet]({% link /assets/files/sca-coaches.pdf %}){:target="_blank"}
for coaches, sign it at the beginning of each season, and return it
to the league safety officer.

For more, please see the Eric Paredes Save A Life Foundation's [Free SCA
Prevention Training](https://epsavealife.org/sca-prevention-training/).

### Coaching Bases

Every team should have 2 coaches in addition to the team manager. 
During games, a team will always need 1 registered adult in the
dugout and 2 to serve as 1st and 3rd base coaches.

If enough adults are not available, _players_ can serve as base
coaches, but they cannot oversee the dugout.
{: .notice--success }

Little League has a great article on [Coaching
Bases](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/coaching-the-bases-101/)
that gives some introductory tips.

## Pitching Limits

Players of all ages may only throw a limited number of pitches per day and
keeping track of this is an essential part of keeping your players healthy.
The scorekeepers usually track it during games, but it's helpful, as a coach,
to keep track of your players' limits so that you can manage your pitching roster
and substitutions effectively.

See [our pitch counts]({{ site.baseurl }}/rules#pitch-counts) Rules section for details.
 
SportsSafety.org's [Looking for Relief... Pitching, Pitch Counts, and What to Look
For](https://sportssafety.org/articles/#1487006133811-63fc5540-61be){:target="_blank"}
talks about a number of injuries players can get from overuse, and how to identify them.

## FAQ

### _How big will my team be?_

In T-Ball and Minors, there are no limits to the size of a team. The average
is about 12 players, but it varies year to year.

In all higher divisions, a team must be between 10-15 players. In Juniors and
Seniors (which we don't generally do at SMLL), if there's only 1 team, it can
have up to 20 players.

See Rule III of the
[Little League rulebook](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/rules-regulations-policies/){:target="blank"}
and [Determining Roster Sizes for Teams](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/preparing-team-rosters/){:target="_blank"}.
{: .notice }

### _What if I can't make all the games?_

An assistant coach or a team parent can cover practices and games
if the head coach can't make it. Don't let that hold you back from
signing up as a coach!

### _Are there team pictures?_

The league provides team photos as part of the registration fee.
They're typically taken near the end of the season, in April or May.
Keep an eye on the [News]({% link _pages/news.md %}) page for an announcement.

### _When and where can I practice?_

All practices are held at the [league's fields]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/#fields)
behind the Oakhurst Community Center. Board members will reach out to coaches
at the beginning of the season to coordinate practice times for each division.

Minors field:
* Tee ball
* Player and Coach Pitch
* Minors
* AAA
* Softball

Majors field:
* AAA
* Majors
* 50/70

### _Can I borrow players for a game?_

Yes and no. Players cannot be loaned and borrowed directly between
coaches. The process must be coordinated through the league's
[Player Agent]({% link _pages/contact.md %}), where available players
are part of a pool and assigned as needed by the agent.

See Little League's [What is a Player
Pool](https://www.littleleague.org/help-center/what-is-a-player-pool/).
{: .notice }

Please note that pool players may not pitch in games with their
temporary teams. They must be used to play for 9 consecutive defensive
outs and bat once.

See [Little League® Significant Rule and Regulation Updates for
2021]({% link /assets/files/2021-rulebook-significant-updates.pdf %}),
under "Regulation V(c)" for more information.
{: .notice }

### _Can a coach warm up pitchers or catchers?_

You sure can! This was prohibited until recently, but changes for 2023
include this update:

> **Rule 3.09:**
>
> _This would aid in efforts to improve the pace of play by allowing
> adult coaches to warm up pitchers for regular season only._
> 
> Managers or coaches ~~must not~~ **are permitted** to warm up a pitcher
> at home plate or in the bullpen or elsewhere at any time including
> in-game warm-up, pre-game warm-up, and in other instances. They may
> also stand by to observe a pitcher during warm-up in the bullpen.

See [Little League® Significant Rule and Regulation Updates for
2023]({% link /assets/files/2023-rulebook-significant-changes.pdf %}).
{: .notice }

### _Can youth play on more than one team or in more multiple divisions?_

Yes. Please [reach out]({% link _pages/contact.md %}) to the league Player Agent
with questions about this.
