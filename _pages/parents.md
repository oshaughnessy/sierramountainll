Welcome, parents! Please see the information below, where we've tried to answer
many common questions.

## Eligibility

Boys and girls ages 4-13 can play baseball with the Sierra Mountain Little
League.  Girls ages 9-12 can play softball here.

You can find out your player's age for league placement at the
[Little League Age Finder](https://www.littleleague.org/play-little-league/determine-league-age/).
Note that the formulas for baseball and softball league ages are different:
a baseball player's is how old they are on Aug 31, a softball player's is
how old they were at the end of the year prior.


## Register

SMLL's primary season is in the spring.  We open registration from
December through February and expect to start our practices immediately
after the Bass Lake School District's spring break. Our game season
is typically from late March through early June, with playoffs and
All Stars continuing for a few weeks afterward.

If you'd like to sign up your kids:

1. **Register** players at [Sports Connect](https://www.sierramountainll.com/Default.aspx?tabid=716497){:target="_blank"}.

2. Players in AAA and above will need to attend a player assessment
   sometime in February.

2. Your players will be **assigned to teams** between assessments
   and the start of the season.
   The registration system will send out email notifications once
   players have been assigned.
   Coaches will reach out in this period to announce practices.

3. The **first games** are generally 2 weeks after practices begin,
   sometime in the 2nd half of March.

4. The **last games** of the season will usually be at the end of May
   or the beginning of June.

**See the [News]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/) section for specific dates.**

### How do I know my kids' league age?

Please see the [League Age &amp; Divisions]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/01/18/league-age/)
post for an overview of how player ages work with our game divisions.

## Volunteer

Sierra Mountain Little League is run entirely by volunteers -- working parents
just like you who want to invest in their kids and their community. The whole
system takes a lot of time and effort and many hands working together to make
it happen. After you register your players in Sports Connect, you're given a
chance to sign up for various ways we need help. Please consider registering
your interest through one of the available options there, or reach out to
your coach as soon as teams are assigned.

Volunteer opportunities include:
* Being a [team manager or coach]({{ site.baseurl }}/coaches)
* Helping your coach with practices and games
* Keeping score during games
* Serving in the snack bar during games
* Being a team parent, helping with organization and communicating with the other parents
* Helping prep fields before games -- raking, chalking, putting out bases,
  sweeping the dugouts, putting the pitching mound on the Minors field, cleaning up
  the seating areas, returning the trash cans to their space by the snack bar.

Any volunteer who provides "regular service to the league or repetitive access
to children," must go through the background check process. That includes helping
with hitting and catching during practice, coaching a base or coordinating
the batting lineup during games, even working in the snack bar or being a team
parent.  Please see Little League's [Background Checks for Little League®
Volunteers](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/background-checks-for-little-league-volunteers/) for more info.

## Player Safety

SMLL places a lot of value on player safety. If your child has any special
health conditions, like the need for an EpiPen or an inhaler, please talk to your
coaches about it. Make sure they know how to recognize signs of problems and how
to deal with them. They'll want to be prepared in case there's an emergency,
and they should be able to recognize changes in your childrens' normal behavior.


## Equipment

What do your kids need to play baseball or softball with SMLL?[^1]

* ball glove
* cleats
* uniform pants
* uniform belt
* uniform socks
* athletic supporter or compression shorts (required for all boys;
  catchers must wear a cup)
* batting helmet (encouraged to purchase your own)
* bat (optional but recommended)
* batting gloves (optional but recommended)

What does the league provide?[^2]

* game-day jersey
* baseball cap
* catcher's gear for the team
* batting helmets as needed
* bats as needed

Bringing your own bat and helmet is optional. The league or coach
can provide both, and many players are happy to share their bats.
Don't be afraid to ask your coach or someone else in the league
for hand-me down gear, too. Kids are always growing out of their
equipment and parents are often pleased to have the opportunity to
pass it on.

What can't your kids wear?

* jewelry, rings, pins, hard cosmetics, hard decorative items
* watches

See the Little League Rulebook's [Appendix B - Safety Code for Little
League](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/appendices/appendix-b/)
for the exact rules, and [Get the Gear and What to Wear for Little League®
Practices](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/get-the-gear-and-what-to-wear-for-little-league-practices/) for more tips on what's needed and useful.

More guidance for how we approach equipment at SMLL is given below.

### Bats

Little League offers a [Bat Information](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/playing-equipment-inspection-baseball-softball-bats/)
page that collects their rules and guidelines.

Curious what umpires are looking for when they do a bat inspection
before every game? See [Playing Equipment Inspection: Baseball and Softball
Bats](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/playing-equipment-inspection-baseball-softball-bats/)

Bats must be in good repair and not be altered ([see LL Rulebook
Appendix D](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/appendices/appendix-d/)).

Please note that bat warm-up donuts are not allowed.

Pine tar and other adhesives are strictly prohibited.

#### Baseball

| Division             | Standard | Dimensions         | Notes |
|----------------------|----------|--------------------|-------|
| Tee Ball             | USA Bat  | Length <= 26"      | Only for use with approved Tee Balls |
| AAA, Minors, Majors  | USA Bat  | Length <= 33"<br />Diameter <= 2 5/8" | For wood, USA Bat not required |
| Intermediate (50-70) | USA Bat, BBCOR | Length <= 34"<br />Diameter <= 2 5/8" | For wood, USA Bat not required |

For all baseball players from Tee Ball to Majors, non-wood bats must
be certified by USA Baseball and marked with the USA Bat standard
(they will say "USA Baseball"). For 50-70, non-wood bats may also
be certified by BBCOR.

Aluminum, composite, hybrid, and wood bats are allowed. See
[Rule 1.10](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/bat-rules/) for details.

#### Softball

| Division             | Standard | Dimensions         | Notes |
|----------------------|----------|--------------------|-------|
| AAA - Majors         | None     | Length <= 33"<br />Diameter <= 2 1/4" | Non-wood -- BPF 1.20 |

For all divisions, a softball bat must meet those limits. It may be wood
or another common bat material. It may be colored. It _must_ have
a grip.

### Hats

Baseball players must wear their cap during a game. It's an important part 
of their uniform toolkit for maintaining good vision and protecting their
eyes and face from the sunlight.

Softball players may wear a cap or visor, but it's not a requirement.
Nevertheless, it is still a valuable shield against strong light and UV.

### Shoes

_Can you use cleats from another sport?_
Yes! Cleats with plastic or rubber studs can be used up through Majors.
In 50-70, Junior, and Senior leagues, [metal-spiked cleats may also be
used](https://www.littleleague.org/help-center/are-cleats-with-metal-spikes-permitted/).

_Can you use shoes that aren't cleats?_
Yes. Cleats are not _required_, but they are wise. A player should
always wear shoes that will give them good traction in dirt and grass,
fit snugly, and stay on during running and sliding. Laces should be
in good repair and the shoes should be able to stay laced a reasonable
amount of time. Don't get your coach in trouble because your player's
shoes come untied during a game! Your team could be penalized because
a player wasn't ready or safe and delayed the game.

## Pictures

Near the end of every season, the league has a picture day. Team and individual
photos are included as part of registration, and the photographer typically
offers additional packages that players and their families may purchase.

## Rule Highlights

Little League has highlighted a number of things that are often
misunderstood at Little League baseball. Please see [Common Little
League® Rule Misconceptions: What Parents Need to
Know](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/common-little-league-rule-misconceptions-what-parents-need-to-know/) and [10 Commonly Misinterpreted Little League®
