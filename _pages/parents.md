Welcome, parents! Please see the information below, where we've tried to answer
many common questions.

## Eligibility

Boys and girls ages 4-13 can play baseball with the Sierra Mountain Little
League.  Girls ages 9-12 can play softball here.

You can find out your player's age for league placement at the
[Little League Age Finder](https://www.littleleague.org/play-little-league/determine-league-age/).
Note that the formulas for baseball and softball league ages are different.


## Register

SMLL's primary season is in the spring.  We open registration from
December through February and expect to start our practices immediately
after the Bass Lake School District's spring break. Our game season
is typically from late March through early June, with playoffs and
All Stars continuing for a few weeks afterward.

If you'd like to sign up your kids:

1. **Register** players at [Sports Connect](https://www.sierramountainll.com/Default.aspx?tabid=716497){:target="_blank"}.

2. Players in AAA and above will need to attend a player assessment
   sometime in February.

2. Your players will be **assigned to teams** between assessments
   and the start of the season.
   The registration system will send out email notifications once
   players have been assigned.
   Coaches will reach out in this period to announce practices.

3. The **first games** are generally 2 weeks after practices begin,
   sometime in the 2nd half of March.

4. The **last games** of the season will usually be at the end of May
   or the beginning of June.

**See the [News]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/) section for specific dates.**

### How do I know my kids' league age?

Please see the [League Age &amp; Divisions]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/01/18/league-age/)
post for an overview of how player ages work with our game divisions.

## Volunteer

_TBD: call to action; what do we require?_

Volunteers](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/background-checks-for-little-league-volunteers/)

## Player Safety

SMLL places a lot of value on player safety. If your child has any special
health conditions, like the need for an EpiPen or an inhaler, please talk to your
coaches about it. Make sure they know how to recognize signs of problems and how
to deal with them. They'll want to be prepared in case there's an emergency,
and they should be able to recognize changes in your childrens' normal behavior.


## Equipment

What do your kids need to play baseball or softball with SMLL?[^1]

* cleats
* uniform pants

Yes! Cleats with plastic or rubber studs can be used up through Majors.

Near the end of every season, the league has a picture day. Team and individual
photos are included as part of registration, and the photographer typically
offers additional packages that players and their families may purchase.
