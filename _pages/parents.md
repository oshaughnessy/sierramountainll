Welcome, parents! Please see the information below, where we've tried to answer
many common questions.


## Who can play?

![SMLL Boys]({% link /assets/images/smll-boys.jpg %}){: .align-left .third-width }

Boys and girls ages 4-13 can play baseball with the Sierra Mountain Little
League. Girls ages 9-12 can play softball here.

You can find out your player's age for division placement at the
[Little League Age Finder](https://www.littleleague.org/play-little-league/determine-league-age/).
Note that the formulas for baseball and softball league ages are different:
a baseball player's is how old they are on Aug 31, a softball player's is
how old they were at the end of the year prior.

## Sign Up

SMLL's primary season is in the spring.  We open registration from
December through February and expect to start our practices immediately
after the Bass Lake School District's spring break. Our game season
is typically from late March through early June, with playoffs and
All Stars continuing for a few weeks afterward.

If you'd like to sign up your kids:

1. **Register** players at [Sports Connect](https://www.sierramountainll.com/Default.aspx?tabid=716497){:target="_blank"}.

2. Players in AAA and above will need to attend a player assessment
   sometime in February.

2. Your players will be **assigned to teams** between assessments
   and the start of the season.
   The registration system will send out email notifications once
   players have been assigned.
   Coaches will reach out in this period to announce practices.

3. The **first games** are generally 2 weeks after practices begin,
   sometime in the 2nd half of March.

4. The **last games** of the season will usually be at the end of May
   or the beginning of June.

**See the [News]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/) section for specific dates.**

### How do I know my kid's league age?

Please see the [League Age &amp; Divisions]({% post_url 2023-01-18-league-age %})
post for an overview of how player ages work with our game divisions.

## Volunteer

Sierra Mountain Little League is run entirely by volunteers -- working parents
just like you who want to invest in their kids and their community. The whole
system takes a lot of time and effort and many hands working together to make
it happen. After you register your players in Sports Connect, you're given a
chance to sign up for various ways we need help. Please consider registering
your interest through one of the available options there, or reach out to
your coach as soon as teams are assigned.

Volunteer opportunities include:
* Being a [team manager or coach]({{ site.baseurl }}/coaches)
* Helping your coach with practices and games
* Keeping score during games
* Serving in the snack bar during games
* Being a team parent, helping with organization and communicating with the other parents
* Helping prep fields before games -- raking, chalking, putting out bases,
  sweeping the dugouts, putting the pitching mound on the Minors field, cleaning up
  the seating areas, returning the trash cans to their space by the snack bar.

Please see our [Roles]({% link _pages/roles.md %}) page for more info.


## Player Safety

SMLL places a lot of value on player safety. If your child has any special
health conditions, like the need for an EpiPen or an inhaler, please talk to your
coaches about it. Make sure they know how to recognize signs of problems and how
to deal with them. They'll want to be prepared in case there's an emergency,
and they should be able to recognize changes in your childrens' normal behavior.

Note that every season, one coach on every team must get training for first aid
and basic baseball fundamentals.

All clothing and equipment should be in good repair. Bats may not be damaged.
Boys need to wear an athletic supporter. Male catchers must wear a cup.  Aside
from some exceptions, jewelry is not allowed ([see below](#wearing-jewelry)).

Player safety also includes vetting our volunteers with in-depth background checks
and training them to recognize abuse. Please see our [Background
Checks &amp; Training]({% link _pages/volunteers.md %}) page for more information.

Little League also encourages parents to take advantage of USA Baseball's 
[Abuse Awareness for Minors](https://usabdevelops.com/page/3532/courses/13975/abuse-awareness-for-minors)
program as well.


### Concussion Awareness

All parents of SMLL's players should read this [concussion information
sheet]({% link /assets/files/headsup-parents.pdf %}){:target="_blank"}
from the CDC, sign it at the beginning of each season, and return it to their coach.

For more, please see the CDC's HEADS UP to Youth Sports [for
parents](https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/youthsports/parents.html).


### Sudden Cardiac Arrest

All parents of SMLL's players should read this [sudden cardiac arrest information
sheet]({% link /assets/files/sca-parents.pdf %}){:target="_blank"},
sign it at the beginning of each season, and return it to their coach.

For more, please see the Eric Paredes Save A Life Foundation's [Free SCA
Prevention Training](https://epsavealife.org/sca-prevention-training/).


### Wearing Jewelry

Little League Rule 1.11(j) states:

> Players must not wear jewelry such as, but not limited to,
> rings, watches, earrings, bracelets, necklaces, nor any
> hard cosmetic/decorative items. This rule applies regardless
> of the composition of such jewelry, hard cosmetic item, or
> hard decorative item. **Hard items to control the hair, such
> as beads, are permitted.**
>
> EXCEPTION: Jewelry that alerts medical personnel to a specific condition
> is permissible.

Practices](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/get-the-gear-and-what-to-wear-for-little-league-practices/){:target="_blank"} for more tips on what's needed and useful.
{: .notice }

What does the league provide?[^1]

* game-day jersey

See [What Parents, Local Leagues Need to Know About Equipping a Little
Leaguer®](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/parents-local-leagues-need-know-equipping-little-leaguer/){:target="_blank"}
{: .notice }

Bringing your own bat and helmet is optional. The league or coach
can provide both, and many players are happy to share their bats.
Don't be afraid to ask your coach or someone else in the league
for hand-me down gear, too. Kids are always growing out of their
equipment and parents are often pleased to have the opportunity to
pass it on.

See the Little League Rulebook's [Appendix B - Safety Code for Little
League](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/appendices/appendix-b/){:target="_blank"}
for the exact rules.

More guidance for how we approach equipment at SMLL is given below.

### Bats

Little League offers a [Bat Information](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/playing-equipment-inspection-baseball-softball-bats/)
page that collects their rules and guidelines.

Curious what umpires are looking for when they do a bat inspection
before every game? See [Playing Equipment Inspection: Baseball and Softball
Bats](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/playing-equipment-inspection-baseball-softball-bats/)

Bats must be in good repair and not be altered ([see LL Rulebook
Appendix D](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/appendices/appendix-d/)).

Please note that bat warm-up donuts are not allowed.
{: .notice--danger }

Pine tar and other adhesives are strictly prohibited.

#### <span class=baseball>Baseball</span>

| Division             | Standard | Dimensions         | Notes |
|----------------------|----------|--------------------|-------|
| Tee Ball             | USA Bat  | Length <= 26"      | Only for use with approved Tee Balls |
| AAA, Minors, Majors  | USA Bat  | Length <= 33"<br />Diameter <= 2 5/8" | For wood, USA Bat not required |
| Intermediate (50-70) | USA Bat, BBCOR | Length <= 34"<br />Diameter <= 2 5/8" | For wood, USA Bat not required |

For all baseball players from Tee Ball to Majors, non-wood bats must
be certified by USA Baseball and marked with the USA Bat standard
(they will say "USA Baseball"). For 50-70, non-wood bats may also
be certified by BBCOR.

Aluminum, composite, hybrid, and wood bats are allowed.
See [baseball rule 1.10](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/bat-rules/#baseball) for details.
{: .notice--success }

#### <span class=softball>Softball</span>

| Division                 | Standard | Dimensions         | Notes |
|--------------------------|----------|--------------------|-------|
| Tee Ball, Minors, Majors | None     | Length <= 33"<br />Diameter <= 2 1/4" | Non-wood -- BPF 1.20 |
| Juniors, Seniors         | None     | Length <= 34"<br />Diameter <= 2 1/4" | Non-wood -- BPF 1.20 |

For all divisions, a softball bat must meet those limits. It may be wood
or another common bat material. It may be colored. It _must_ have a grip
if it's not wood.

See [softball rule 1.10](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/bat-rules/#softball) for details.
{: .notice--success }

### Softballs

If you want to buy your player a <span class=softball>softball</span>
to practice with at home, make sure you get one of the right dimensions.
These are the sizes we'll use in each division:

| Division         | Diameter | Weight   |
|------------------|----------|----------|
| Tee Ball, Minors | 11"      | 5&frac12;-6 oz |
| Majors+          | 12"      | 6&frac14;-7 oz |

Note that optic yellow, white, or other colors are all permitted.

Little League [endorses some balls](https://www.littleleague.org/partnerships/licensing/shop-little-league-products/on-field/), but any ball of the right dimensions should be fine.
Please see Rule 1.09 of the [official Little League Softball
rules](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/rules-regulations-policies/){:target="blank"}
for specific ball regulations.
{: .notice }

### Hats

<span class=baseball>Baseball players</span> must wear their cap during a game.
It's an important part of their uniform toolkit for maintaining good vision and
protecting their eyes and face from the sunlight.

<span class=softball>Softball players</span> may wear a cap or visor, but it's
not a requirement.  Nevertheless, it is still a valuable shield against strong
light and UV.

### Shoes

_"Can you use cleats from another sport?"_
Yes! Cleats with plastic or rubber studs can be used up through Majors.
In 50-70, Junior, and Senior leagues, [metal-spiked cleats may also be
used](https://www.littleleague.org/help-center/are-cleats-with-metal-spikes-permitted/).

_"Can you use shoes that aren't cleats?"_
Yes. Cleats are not _required_, but they are wise. A player should
always wear shoes that will give them good traction in dirt and grass,
fit snugly, and stay on during running and sliding. Laces should be
in good repair and the shoes should be able to stay laced a reasonable
amount of time. Don't get your coach in trouble because your player's
shoes come untied during a game! Your team could be penalized because
a player wasn't ready or safe and delayed the game.

### Pitcher Arm Coverings

Pitchers may wear an undershirt, but the sleeves must _not_ be white or
gray if they're visible.

Pitchers may wear a play-calling band on their glove arm. It must be
a solid color and not white, gray, or optic yellow.

Pitchers may not wear sweat bands on their hands, wrists, or arms.


## Pictures

Near the end of every season, the league has a picture day. Team and individual
photos are included as part of registration, and the photographer typically
offers additional packages that players and their families may purchase.

## Rule Highlights
