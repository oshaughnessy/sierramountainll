For our kids to play and our league to function, we need volunteers
for many roles. "Coach" is the first that probably comes to mind,
but running a team takes a lot of different skills, and it can often
be easier if the effort is shared by people who enjoy different
strengths.

We also have volunteers who aren't parents of players, but know the
game and see the value of bringing Little League to the community.
To all of you, we appreciate your support and passion for the youth
here. Thank you!

There are many ways to serve. After you decide what to do, please
see the [Registration](#registration) section farther down.


## Roles

### Team Manager

At a small league like SMLL, the team manager and coach roles are
often combined. We'll list many of the needs here, but these are
usually shared by the assistant coaches as well.

The team manager has many tasks outside of teaching kids how to play
baseball, but they're just as important if we want them to function
as a team, within a league, using shared fields:

- coordinating **practice field usage** with the league's player agent;
- **scheduling practices** and communicating their times
  (see [When and where can I
  practice?]({{ site.baseurl }}/coaches/#when-and-where-can-i-practice)
- communicating the **game schedule** and any changes
- adjusting and communicating plans for **make-up games**
- **preparing the field** before games (chalking, raking, watering,
  putting out bases)
- helping **clean the dugout** after games (please!)
- attending **player assessment days** (you might want to call them
  "drafts" or "tryouts", but nobody _tries out_ for a team at SMLL);
  see [Tips for Managers Prepping for Player Tryouts](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/tips-for-managers-prepping-for-player-tryouts/) for more

### Coach / Assistant Coach

The coach role is more about building player skills than managing
the team, and it's often the same person leading both. SMLL's
Sports Connect system has an "Assistant Coach" volunteer position
available during registration, and they can help out in many ways:

- **deciding on batting order** before games
  (note that we adopted a continuous batting order in 2023)
- **coordinating batting lineup** in the dugout during games
- **base coach** for 1st and 3rd base
- handling **field substitutions** during games
- ensuring all players get **adequate game time**
- [**track pitch count** and rest days]({{ site.baseurl }}/coaches/#pitch-counts)
  for all pitchers
- [**protecting players** from injury]({{ site.baseurl }}/coaches/#player-safety)
  or health problems (e.g. paying attention to field hazards, ensuring safe play
  at practice and games, adjusting practices for heat, cold, or dark, attending
  seasonal first aid training)

Every team should have 2 coaches in addition to the team manager. 
During games, a team will always need 1 registered adult in the
dugout and 2 to serve as 1st and 3rd base coaches. If enough adults
are not available, players can serve as base coaches, but they
cannot oversee the dugout.

### Team Parent

Team moms and dads help take the communication and coordination load
off the manager and coaches. They're an invaluable part of making the
team work.

One way team parents can help out a lot is by communicating with the
other parents. This can make life much easier for the coach. Make sure
everybody knows about practices and game times. Coordinate snack bar
and scorekeeper volunteers. Make sure the players have snacks and sports
drinks during and after the games. (Even the older kids like snacks,
especially when it's hot out!) Help arrange an end-of-season party or
trophy orders, if the coach wants to hand them out.

### Grounds Maintenance

Board members and coaches are often the people picking up trash, moving
the cans around, checking on the bathrooms, etc. Fields need to be raked
before games, dugouts need to be swept, trash needs to be collected and
disposed of. People dedicated to helping with the general upkeep of the
public areas, the dugouts, and the fields would be deeply appreciated.

### Scorekeeper

Each team should supply a scorekeeper at every game. We teach new
people to do it every year, and it can be a fun part of the experience.

### Snack Shack

SMLL's primary fundraiser is the snack bar that we open on game days.
Many parents like to help there at a time before or after their kids
are playing so they can see their games, too.

### Umpires

_We need umpires!_ Umpires oversee all of our games from the player
pitch division and above, and we can't play without them.

Our [Umpire in Chief]({% link _pages/contact.md %}), Tom Burdette, is
always looking for new people, 13-90, to help keep our players safe
and enforce the rules. He will host training sessions each season,
and every game will have experienced umpires to speak as the ultimate
authority so new ones have time to grow into the role.

Any youth who are interested,
especially, would be welcome to reach out. It's a great way to
learn confidence, responsibility, and acting in authority around
other kids and adults.

If you're interested, please text Tom at `831-818-6859`.


## Registration

Any volunteer who provides "regular service to the league or repetitive access
to children" must go through the background check process. That includes helping
with hitting and catching during practice, coaching a base or coordinating
the batting lineup during games, even working in the snack bar or being a team
parent. Please see Little League's [Background Checks for Little LeagueÂ®
Volunteers](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/background-checks-for-little-league-volunteers/) for more info.

1. First, see the [Volunteer](https://www.sierramountainll.com/Default.aspx?tabid=716513&familyid=1280771057954850150&subctl=volunteersinfo){:target="_blank"}
    section in Sports Connect and **sign up for a position** there.

2. Be aware that all volunteers who spend significant time with kids
   must go through a **background check**. The league will submit this
   for you using your registration info. See our
   [background checks]({% link _pages/bgchecks.md %}) page for more.

3. Complete USA Baseball's [Abuse Awareness for Adults at usabdevelops.com](https://usabdevelops.com/page/3532/courses?page=1&TAG_ID=2188). If you need to register for a new account, note that "Sierra Mountain
   Little League" is not listed under "Little League - Local Leagues".
   Select "\*\* Little League", then click "+ Join" instead.

   If you've already completed a Safe Sport Abuse Awareness training program for another sport
   or league and your certificate is still current, you can use it for Little League, too.
   For example, [US Soccer's SafeSport program](https://learning.ussoccer.com/coach/courses/available/29/details/5606) is adequate for our needs.

### If you're a manager or coach...

{:start="4"}
4. Complete the **coaching courses**:
     * [Concussion training](https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/youthsports/training/index.html){:target="_blank"} is
       annual training [required by California law](https://www.littleleague.org/player-safety/concussions-youth-athletes/){:target="_blank"} for any coach working in a youth sport.
     * Please see the other [**coaching courses**]({{ site.baseurl }}/coaches/#what-do-i-need-to-be-a-coach).
       First aid and fundamental baseball training are Little League requirements.

<!--
5. Register a **Live Scan**. This only needs to be done once by each league
   manager and coach and does not need to be done annually. A Live Scan for
   another organization cannot be used by SMLL.

**Please Note**:
For registrations, it is essential that you use your full legal name. The system that
processes your Live Scan application will only be able to connect your information
to our registration system if they all have the same name. The Live Scan application
runs through the California Department of Justice, where it will need to match your
registered legal name.
