## SMLL Ground Rules

Please see [our ground rules for 2023]({% link /assets/files/smll-ground-rules-2023.pdf %}).
Now for this year, they include the allowance of Game Changer for keeping score
and the adoption of continuous batting orders in all divisions.

## Coaches During Games

Only 3 coaches per team are allowed on the field during games, which includes 2
base coaches and 1 adult who must supervise the dugout while the team is at bat.

People can't just freely exchange roles during a game. A person outside the
field must stay outside the field, and a person on the field must fulfill all
the roles of a team coach throughout.

Coaches, consider arranging with a team parent to assist with off-field needs
during the game. It can be _very_ helpful to have someone to find that player
who took too long on a bathroom break, to fetch a drink for the player getting
dehydrated, or to re-supply your hungry players from the snack shed.

## Game Times, Lead Limits, Mercy Rules

_(Forthcoming)_

## Pitching Limits

Pitchers in every division have limits on the number of pitches they can
throw in a game, how many days of rest they need afterward, and when they
can switch between catcher and pitcher. See [our pitch counts](#pitch-counts)
section for details.

## Stealing Bases

_According to Rule 7.13..._

In <span class=baseball>baseball</span>, the basic rule is this:

> When a pitcher is in contact with the pitcher's plate and in possession
> of the ball and the catcher is in the catcher's box ready for delivery
> of the ball, base runners shall not leave their bases until the ball has
> been delivered and has reached the batter.

In other words, the ball has to reach the plate before a base runner
can start to steal.

SMLL has adopted a local rule that there will be no base stealing in T-ball.

In <span class=softball>softball</span>, from Majors up, base runners may
not leave their bases until the pitched ball has been released by the pitcher.
In Minors, they may not leave until the ball reaches the batter.

According to Rule 7.08(a)(5), runners are out for violating those rules.
_But..._ if the softball slips from the pitcher's hand, it's in play and the
runner may attempt to steal.
