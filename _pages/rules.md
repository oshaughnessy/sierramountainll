In the sections below, we've tried to summarize Little League rules that stand
out as things our coaches should know, for regular season games in T-Ball through
50-70, here at Sierra Mountain Little League. We also highlight our local "ground
rules", where we call out the special circumstances related to our facilities and
describe the approved divergences and intepretations of Little League's official rules.

These describe the general conditions for most scenarios encountered by
the coaches at SMLL and are a best effort at summarizing the rules. The [official Little League
rules](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/rules-regulations-policies/){:target="blank"},
subject to approved modifications as listed in [SMLL's Ground Rules](#smll-ground-rules),
 are the final word. At games, the umpires are the final word.

In addition, Little League offers their own lists of rule highlights:
* for coaches: [10 Commonly Misinterpreted Little League®
  Rules](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/10-commonly-misinterpreted-little-league-rules/){:target="_blank"}
* for parents: [Common Little League® Rule Misconceptions: What Parents Need to
Know](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/common-little-league-rule-misconceptions-what-parents-need-to-know/){:target="_blank"}

## SMLL Ground Rules

Please see [our latest ground rules]({% link /assets/files/smll-ground-rules-2023.pdf %}).
New for 2023, they include the allowance of Game Changer for keeping score
and the adoption of continuous batting orders in all divisions.

### SMLL Local Field Rules

1. Any kid warming up an outfielder _must_ have a helmet on.
2. Home dugout is always third base dugout.
3. _No one_ is allowed to use tobacco or alcohol while at the Little League fields.
4. Vulgar language and unsportsmanlike behavior _will not be tolerated_ -- this will lead to
   an automatic ejection from the game; please refer to the [Player and Parents Codes of
   Conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#smll-forms).
5. Only approved [Managers, Coaches, Players, and registered
   volunteers]({% link _pages/volunteers.md %}) are allowed in the dugout or on the
   playing field during games and practices
6. The home team is responsible for turning the lights on and off, locking and unlocking
   the restrooms, cleaning up trash, emptying the trash cans, prepping the field, and
   dragging the field after the game.
7. Children and Players are not allowed to play around the main buildings of the community center;
   they are especially not allowed to play on the big hills behind the field as this is a safety
   hazard. Players caught playing around these areas will be suspended from the next game.
8. A batted fly ball in fair territory which hits the wires hanging over the Major and Minor
   A left field will be ruled a ground rule double.
9. Makeup games will be scheduled during free blocks of time.
10. Major teams will have preference on the Major field. Thereafter, the field/practice
    schedule will be determined at the coaches meeting. Major teams will have preference over
    Minor teams for the major field. The order for picking the schedule will be determined by
    the reverse order of the draft and the practice schedule will be posted in the dugout.
11. Home runs _must_ clear the fence and the yellow tubing.
12. If a batted ball hits a wire, it cannot be caught for an out.
13. A fair batted ball going through the fence will result in a ground rule double.
14. A pitched ball trapped in the backstop will be a dead ball; no runner may advance.

### Team Size and Substitutions

| Division        | Min Defensive Players on Field | Max Def. Players | Batting Plan |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|------------------|--------------|

{: .small }

Player sharing is possible between teams in various ways, depending on division:

* *In T-Ball and Minors*: players may be shared at the team managers' discretion.
* *In AAA and above*: players must be borrowed from the player pool. Speak to
  [our Player Agent]({% link _pages/contact.md %}) if you need to request a player.

### Game Times

Game times are complicated to summarize. For regular season games, these are the
basic parameters:

| Division        | Max Time | Min Innings    | Max Innings | Regulation Innings |
|-----------------|:---------|:---------------|:----------- |:-------------------|
| Tee Ball        | 1:00     | 3&frac12; or 4\* | 6     | 6 |
| Minors          | 1:30[^1] | 3&frac12; or 4   | 5[^1] | 6 |
| AAA             | 1:45[^1] | 3&frac12; or 4   | 6     | 6 |
| Majors          | None     | 3&frac12; or 4   | 6     | 6 |
| 50-70 and above | 2:00     | 4&frac12; or 5   | None  | 7 |

\* Rule 4.10(c)(3): games will end half an inning earlier if the home team still has the lead
after the visiting team has completed its first 4 (or 5) half-innings
{: .small }

There are various circumstances, like tied scores, run rules (see below), and curfew, that
prompt earlier finishes, longer times, or more innings.  Please see section 4.10 of the
[Little League rulebook](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/rules-regulations-policies/){:target="blank"}
for specifics.
{: .notice--warning }

### Run Rules

When a team has a strong lead over its oppenent, the team behind in runs should
concede victory and the game can be terminated before a "full" number of innings
is played, as long as all players have met their minimum play requirements.

For regular season games:

| In Divisions      |   Lead       |  Home has lead | Visitors have lead |
|                   |   _Runs_     |  _at Inning_   | _at Inning_        |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------:|-------------------:|
| AAA\*[^1]         | _10 or more_ | _3&frac12;_    | _4_                |
| Majors            |  15 or more  |  2&frac12;     |  3                 |
|                   | _10 or more_ | _3&frac12;_    | _4_                |
|                   |  8 or more   |  4&frac12;     |  5                 |
| _50-70 and above_ | _15 or more_ | _3&frac12;_    | _4_                |
|                   |  10 or more  |  4&frac12;     |  5                 |
|                   | _8 or more_  | _5&frac12;_    | _6_                |

## Pitch Counts

Pitchers in every division have limits on the number of pitches they can
throw in a game, how many days of rest they need afterward, and when they
can switch between catcher and pitcher.

#### <span class=baseball>Baseball</span> Pitching Limits

| **Age Range** | 6-8  | 9-10  | 11-12 | 13-16 |
|---------------|------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Pitch Limit Per Day** | 50 | 75 | 85 | 95 |

All pitchers must have days to rest after pitching in a game:

| **Pitches**   | 1-20 | 21-35 | 36-50 | 51-65 | 66+ |
|---------------|------|-------|-------|-------|-----|
| **Rest Days** | 0    | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4   |

{% capture pitch-limit-notes %}
Notes:
* Once a pitcher has been removed from the mound, they cannot return as
  a pitcher in the same game.
* A pitcher may finish their current batter once reaching their limit.
* A catcher who has caught for 3 or fewer innings, then throws 21 or more
  pitches in the same day (31 for 15- & 16-year-olds), may not play catcher again
  on that day.
* A catcher who has caught for 4 or more innings in a game may not pitch
  at all on that day.

## Rule Highlights

### Coaches During Games

Only 3 coaches per team are allowed on the field during games, which includes 2
base coaches and 1 adult who must supervise the dugout while the team is at bat.

People can't just freely exchange roles during a game. A person outside the
field must stay outside the field, and a person on the field must fulfill all
the roles of a team coach throughout.

Coaches, consider arranging with a team parent to assist with off-field needs
during the game. It can be _very_ helpful to have someone to find that player
who took too long on a bathroom break, to fetch a drink for the player getting
dehydrated, or to grab those batting gloves someone forgot.
{: .notice--success }

### On Deck

Up through Majors, on-deck batters need to stay in the dugout and leave their bat
on the rack until it's time to hit.

> Regulations prohibit on-deck batters. This means no player should handle
> a bat, even while in an enclosure, until it is his/her time at bat. This
> applies only to Little League (Majors), Minor League, and Tee Ball.

See [Appendix B - Safety Code for Little
League](https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/appendices/appendix-b/){:target="_blank"}

### Mandatory Play

{: .notice }


### Stealing Bases

_According to Rule 7.13..._

In <span class=baseball>baseball</span>, the basic rule is this:

> When a pitcher is in contact with the pitcher's plate and in possession
> of the ball and the catcher is in the catcher's box ready for delivery
> of the ball, base runners shall not leave their bases until the ball has
> been delivered and has reached the batter.

In other words, the ball has to reach the plate from a pitch before a base
runner can start to steal.

SMLL has adopted a local rule that there will be no base stealing in T-ball.

In <span class=softball>softball</span>, from Majors up, base runners may
not leave their bases until the pitched ball has been released by the pitcher.
In Minors, they may not leave until the ball reaches the batter.

According to Rule 7.08(a)(5), runners are out for violating those rules.
_But..._ if the softball slips from the pitcher's hand, it's in play and the
runner may attempt to steal.
