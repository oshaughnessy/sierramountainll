_The Snack Shack is SMLL's primary fundraiser!_[^sponsors]

We work hard to keep our annual player cost as low as possible, and
most of our fees each year get spent making the season happen:
- uniforms
- league fees
- _insurance_
- trash service
- field maintenance (like ground repairs after winter, upgrading school fields)
- equipment maintenance (like the mower)
