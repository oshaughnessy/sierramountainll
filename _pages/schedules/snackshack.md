_The Snack Shack is SMLL's primary fundraiser!_[^sponsors]
{: .notice--success }

We work hard to keep our annual player cost as low as possible, and
most of our fees each year get spent making the season happen:
- uniforms
- player pictures
- Little League fees
- team equipment (balls, catcher's gear)
- _insurance_
- trash service
- field maintenance (like ground repairs after winter, upgrading school fields)
- equipment maintenance & replacement (the mowers, chalk machines, watering system)
- building maintenance
- consumables (like bathroom supplies)
- software fees (like Sports Connect)

_Every_ game costs us, too:
- 3x game balls
- youth umpires are paid
- field chalk
- so much water

We're partnering with our local schools now and working to upgrade infields
at the local elementary and junior highs:
- bases
- home plates
- pitching mounds
- dugouts

All that, and we have things stolen, "borrowed", and broken every year, too.
