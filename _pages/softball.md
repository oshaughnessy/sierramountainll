## Divisions

### 8U/Player Pitch/Minors AA
{: .softball}

**Ages** | 5-8
**Ball** | 11" soft/reduced impact force
**Pitch Distance** | 25'
**Base Distance**  | 60'

8U is our learning division where the youngest girls have a chance to
discover the fundamentals of playing the game. They'll learn how to throw,
catch, run the bases, hit, and, to a more limited degree, pitch. In the 2nd
half of the season, they'll also get a chance to pitch against opponents in
games.

We encourage 5-year-old girls to play a year of tee ball before they join
this division.

This is a coach-to-player pitch division. In the 1st half of the season,
coaches or a machine will throw pitches to batters. In the 2nd half of
the season, players will throw.

PLEASE NOTE: The rules below are a work in progress. We may revise them as we
go through the 2023 season.
{: .notice--warning }

#### Ground Rules

- Only 1 extra base on an overthrow
- Parent or coach as umpire
- Defensive coaches are allowed on the field during game play
  to instruct their players

#### Pitching

1st half of the season:
- **Coaches will pitch to their own players**
- Coaches may throw from a standing position or sitting on a ball bucket
- 5 and 6-year-old players may use a tee at the coach's discretion

2nd half of the season:
- **Defense will pitch to opposing players**
- 5 balls per batter
- 3 strikes per batter
- After 3 walked batters, player pitching should rotate out.

All season:
- 8 pitches max per hitter
- Batters can run when fouling off a 3rd-strike hit
- No outs are called on a 3rd strike; player simply returns to the dugout
- Half-inning ends when all players have played through the lineup, defense
  causes 3 fielded outs, or 5 runs are scored

#### Stealing

Stealing is not permitted in 8U. Once a ball is in the pitcher's control,
a runner may not leave their base until a batter hits the ball into fair
territory.


### 10U/Minors AAA
{: .softball}

**Ages** | 9-10
**Ball** | 12" standard
**Pitch Distance** | 35'
**Base Distance**  | 60'

10U is our transition division, where girls learn to play more strictly by
the rules of softball. It's a full player-pitch division, so the players
themselves will be throwing all pitches against batters.

PLEASE NOTE: The rules below are a work in progress. We may revise them as we
go through the 2023 season.
{: .notice--warning }

#### Stealing

Once a ball is under the control of the pitcher, runners may not
leave their base until the next pitch is thrown and the ball reaches
the batter.

**Ball** | 12" standard

{: .softball}

**Ages** | 13-14
**Ball** | 12" standard
