## Divisions

### 6U/Coach Pitch/Minors A
{: .softball}

**Ages** | 5-6 (in general)
**Ball** | 11" soft/reduced impact force
**Pitch Distance** | 25'
**Base Distance**  | 60'

6U is our learning division where the youngest girls have a chance to
discover the fundamentals of playing the game. They'll learn how to throw,
catch, run the bases, and hit.

This is a coach-to-player pitch division. In the 1st half of the season,
coaches or a machine will exclusively throw pitches to batters. In the 2nd
half, pitchers will begin to throw for their own teammates.

PLEASE NOTE: The rules below are a work in progress. We may revise them as we
go through the 2023 season.
{: .notice--warning }

#### Ground Rules

- Only 1 extra base on an overthrow
- No stealing
- Parent or coach as umpire
- Defensive coaches are allowed on the field during game play
  to instruct their players

### 8U/Player Pitch/Minors AA
{: .softball}

**Ages** | 7-8 (in general)
**Ball** | 11" soft/reduced impact force
**Pitch Distance** | 25'
**Base Distance**  | 60'

8U is our learning division where young girls with some experience and
growing strength build a stronger understanding of game strategy and position-
oriented skills. We encourage coaches to rotate players through all positions
throughout the season.

This is a coach-to-player pitch division. In the 1st 1/3 of the season,
coaches or a machine will throw pitches to batters. In the 2nd 1/3, players
will throw for their own teammates. In the final 1/3, competitors will pitch
against the other team.

PLEASE NOTE: The rules below are a work in progress. We may revise them as we
go through the 2023 season.
{: .notice--warning }

#### Ground Rules

3rd third of the season:

All season:
- 8 pitches max per hitter
- Batters can run when fouling off a 3rd-strike hit
- No outs are called on a 3rd strike; player simply returns to the dugout
- Half-inning ends when all players have played through the lineup, defense
  causes 3 fielded outs, or 5 runs are scored

#### Stealing

Stealing is not permitted in 8U.

Once a ball is in the pitcher's control, a runner may not leave their base
until a batter hits the ball into fair territory.

the rules of softball. It's a full player-pitch division, so the players
themselves will be throwing all pitches against batters.

PLEASE NOTE: The rules below are a work in progress. We may revise them as we
go through the 2023 season.
