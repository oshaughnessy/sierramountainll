## Interleague Divisions

### Minors AA/Lower Player Pitch/8U
{: .softball}

**Interleague division** | 8U
**Ages** | 6-8
**Ball** | 11" standard softball
**Pitch Distance** | 35'
**Base Distance**  | 60'

Minors AA is a learning division where young girls with some experience and
growing strength build a stronger understanding of game strategy and
position-oriented skills. We encourage coaches to rotate players through
all positions throughout the season.

This is a player pitch division.  Coaches should begin teaching girls to
throw a fastpitch from the very beginning of the season, and teams should
approach early games with extra patience as all teams will be developing brand
new pitchers.

6-year-olds should have spent a season in tee ball before joining softball.
Otherwise, we encourage them to play tee ball or coach-pitch baseball first.
They will need to attend an assessment day and have coach approval before
joining Minors AA.
