## Divisions

### 8U/Player Pitch/Minors
{: .softball}

**Ages** | 6-8 (in general)
**Ball** | 11" soft/reduced impact force
**Pitch Distance** | 25'
**Base Distance**  | 60'

8U is a learning division where young girls with some experience and
growing strength build a stronger understanding of game strategy and position-
oriented skills. We encourage coaches to rotate players through all positions
throughout the season.

This is a coach-to-player pitch division. In the 1st 1/3 of the season,
coaches or a machine will throw pitches to batters. In the 2nd 1/3, players
will throw for their own teammates. In the final 1/3, competitors will pitch
against the other team.

PLEASE NOTE: The rules below are a work in progress. We may revise them as we
go through the 2024 season.
{: .notice--warning }

#### 8U Ground Rules

  to instruct their players
