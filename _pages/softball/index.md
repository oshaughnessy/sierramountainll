## Divisions

### Common Rules

The following rules apply to all divisions:

- 5-run limit per team per inning[^runs]
- Pitchers may wear a face mask while in the pitching position.
- Pitchers are only allowed to pitch 2 consecutive innings, after which another
  pitcher must be substituted in for at least 1 inning. After this, the original
  pitcher may return.
- A team will have a minimum of 8 players at game time. A maximum of 2 players
  may be borrowed from the opponent to reach 8. A player may only be picked up
  3 times per season.
- Continuous batting order is used: all rostered players will bat, in roster order,
  whether or not they are playing a defensive position in the current inning.
- Parent or coach may serve as umpire if no official is available
- Runners are required to slide or attempt to avoid a defensive player on base if the play
  on the runner is close.[^sliding]

8U is a learning division where young girls with some experience
and growing strength build a stronger understanding of game strategy and
position-oriented skills. We encourage coaches to rotate players through
all positions throughout the season.

This is a coach-pitch division. Coaches should begin teaching girls to
throw a fastpitch from the very beginning of the season, and teams should
approach early games with extra patience as all teams will be developing brand
new pitchers.

6-year-olds should have spent a season in tee ball before joining softball.
Otherwise, we encourage them to play tee ball first. They will need to attend
an assessment day and have coach approval before joining 8U.
{: .notice--success}

#### 8U Ground Rules

- Defensive coaches are allowed and encouraged to be on the field during game
  play to instruct their players
- Optional 4th outfielder may be provided to create a 10th defensive player
- Bunting is _not allowed_
- Infield fly rule will _not_ be applied
- Stealing is _not allowed_
- Runners may lead-off at release of pitched ball

#### 8U Coach-Pitching

- After 4 balls, defensive coach will pitch remaining strikes; all coach pitches are strikes
- Coach must have 1 foot on the pitching plate when the ball is released
- Batter hit by pitch once results in ball; batter hit by pitch twice in same at-bat results in award of 1st base

**8U Modified, 1(c)**\
"While the offensive coach is pitching, he/she must remain in contact with the pitching
mound and is not allowed to coach any of his/her players or field any balls."
{: .notice--info }

#### 8U Lead-offs

Lead-off rules follow those of NSA 8U Modified fastpitch softball[^rulebook].

**8U Modified, Section 1(f)**\
"Runners may leave the base once the pitch is released, this includes while the coach is pitching.
Runners may ONLY lead off base when the coach is pitching, they may not steal."
{: .notice--info }

Note that by common agreement with MGS[^partner], we understand this to mean that runners
may lead off when a player or a coach is pitching.

This aligns with the the regular rules of NSA fastpitch softball for divisions 10U and higher:

**Rule 8.8(u):** _The baserunner is out_ \
"when the baserunner(s) fails to keep contact with their base until
a legally pitched ball leaves the pitcher's hand. The ball is dead,
'NO PITCH' is declared and the baserunner(s) is declared out."
{: .notice--info }

#### 8U Sliding

**8U Modified, Section 1(o)**\
"Runners are not required to slide but must try and avoid contact"

_Footnotes_


[^ages]: **[Ages]** Division ages listed here are based on birth year, the way NSA did it prior to the 2025-26 season,
    which [changed to Sep-Aug age groups](https://playnsa.com/2025/07/nsa-changes-age-eligibility-for-new-season/).

[^limit]: **[Time Limits]** For game limits in marked divisions, no new inning is started after the time
    or inning limit is reached. Once an inning has started, it must be finished regardless
    of time unless the home team is ahead. 

[^past]: **[Past Years]** For previous years, see: [2023]({% link _pages/softball/2023.md %}),
    [2024]({% link _pages/softball/2024.md %}).
    [2025 Softball]({% link _pages/softball/2025.md %}).

[^partner]: **[Partners]** MGS and SMLL have worked in close
    partnership each year to create a strong interleague program.

[^runs]: **[Run Limits]** 5-run limit is found in [LL Rule 5.07](https://www.littleleague.org/app/Rulebook/2/159):
    "... (Minor League: The side is retired when three offensive
    players are legally put out, called out by an umpire, or when all
    players on the roster have batted one time in the half-inning or
    when the offensive team scores five (5) runs."

[^rulebook]: **[Rulebooks]** There's no great way to quote a fastpitch rulebook online. NSA shares a PDF,
    Little League shares an app. We use our own divisional rule definitions, in coordination with
    [Mariposa Girls Softball](https://mariposagirlssoftball.org), that are taken from the [NSA rulebook](
    https://playnsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2026-NSA-Fastpitch-Rulebook-P.pdf), but also
    align with many of the rules in the [Little League Rulebook](https://www.littleleague.org/app/Rulebook).
    Our rules are adjusted to be developmentally appropriate for our player community this year.

[^softballs]: **[Softballs]** .47 COR, 375 lb compression, 11" or 12" circumference

[^sliding]: **[Sliding]** [There is no "must slide" rule](
    https://www.umpirebible.com/index.php/rules-base-running/force-play-slide-illegal-slide).
    Little League says runners must "slide or attempt to avoid". NSA is more colorful with
    **Rule 8.7:** "When a defensive player has the ball and is waiting for the runner and
    the runner remains on his/her feet and deliberately, with great force, crashes into the
    defensive player, the runner is declared out. The ball is dead, and all other runners must
    return to the last base touched at the time of the collision."
