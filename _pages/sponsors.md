Many, many thanks to our Sierra Mountain Local Leagues sponsors!

We offer 2 types of sponsorships, for fields and teams.

Field sponsors, at $500, get a banner out on our baseball or softball field, where
you can share the moment and the photo ops with our players' biggest hits.

Team sponsors, at $800, get a banner *and* their name on the back of jerseys for a
group of kids in any one of our divisions, where your name will be seen close up by
the parents in the stands and the sidelines at every game.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/sponsors/sponsor-shots-sgb.jpg"
   alt="South Gate Brewing, a local business, sponsors SMLL"
   caption="Field banner for one of our local sponsors, South Gate Brewing."
%}

If you're interested in supporting the league, please reach out to
[MY Club Athletics]({{ site.baseurl }}/contacts/).

We also accept donations of $25, $50, or $100 through [Square
Up](https://squareup.com/store/sierra-mountain-little-league){:target="_blank"}.
