Many, many thanks to our Sierra Mountain Little Leagues sponsors!

We offer 2 types of sponsorships, for teams and fields.

Team sponsors get their name on the back of jerseys for a group
of kids in our AAA, Majors, or 50-70 division, where your name
will be seen close up by the parents in the stands and the sidelines
at every game.

Field sponsors get a banner out on our Majors field, where you can
share the moment and the photo ops with our players' biggest hits.
