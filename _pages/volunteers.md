## Requirement Details

### Sign Up: Sports Connect

See the
[Volunteer](https://www.sierramountainll.com/Default.aspx?tabid=716513&familyid=1280771057954850150&subctl=volunteersinfo){:target="_blank"}
section in Sports Connect and **sign up for a position** there.

That page has a place to upload your ID and some other clearances,
like a certificate from SafeSport and a few others. When you have those done,
you'll need to return to the Volunteer page to upload those files or images
so we can check them.

### Background Check: JDP

Any volunteer who provides "regular service to the league or repetitive access
to children" must go through the background check process.

{: .notice--warning }
WORK IN PROGRESS! We'll be sending these out to all registered volunteers ASAP,
but it's not ready yet.  With our move to MY Club, we're still figuring out how to
do these through the new org.

{: .notice--success }
This includes helping with hitting and catching during practice,
coaching a base or being in the dugout during games, even working
in the snack bar or being a team parent. It's for anybody who spends
more than 16 hours per month or 32 per year with our youth.

#### Compliance Notice

We are required to provide notice like the following.

In order to be in compliance with [California's Business & Professions Code
§ 18900](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&sectionNum=18900.),
SMLL submits all volunteers to a background check and provides them with CA AB 506-compliant abuse training annually.
This is required of all volunteers, regardless of whether an individual is new to the program or returning.

A background check is performed at the beginning of each season,
with enhanced screening at J.D. Palatine (JDP). This includes:

> the JDP National Criminal Search, plus Developed names, and collects
> data from more than 685 million criminal records, sex offender
> registries in 50 states, OFAC, FBI Terrorist List, Proprietary
> Offender Data, Department of Public Safety, Administrative Office
> of the Courts, Department of Corrections, Federal/State/Local wanted
> fugitive lists, as well as searches of the SafeSport Centralized
> Disciplinary Database and Little League International
> Ineligible/Suspended List.

More information about JD Palatine's youth sports products can be viewed at the
following locations:

### Abuse Awareness

To meet California requirement from AB 506, complete any complaint abuse awareness training program:
- [Little League's abuse awareness training](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/abuse-awareness-training-course/){:target="_blank"}
- [USA Baseball's Abuse Awareness for Adults course](https://usabdevelops.com/page/3532/courses?page=1&TAG_ID=2188).
  More info is available at [USA Baseball's Baseball Athlete Safety Education page](

- [US Soccer's SafeSport program](https://learning.ussoccer.com/coach/courses/available/29/details/5606)

{: .notice--success }
If you've already completed AB 506-compliant abuse awareness training program for another sport
or league and your certificate is still current, you can use it for MY Club, too.  For example,
[US Soccer's SafeSport program](https://learning.ussoccer.com/coach/courses/available/29/details/5606)
is adequate for our needs. Just upload the certificate to your Sports Connect volunteer page.

[Little League's Diamond Leader Training](https://www.littleleague.org/diamondleader).


### Fingerprinting: Live Scans

A Live Scan must be done specifically for MY Club by each coach or other
"regular volunteer". Thankfully, you only need to do it once, It _does not_ need to be
done annually.  rather than annually like the rest of the certs. Unfortunately, though,
a Live Scan for another organization can't be used for MY Club.

   1. Fill out the [MY Club Live Scan form]({% link /assets/files/myclub-livescan-2026.pdf %}).
      Use your full legal name, as found on your driver's license or California ID.
   2. Make an appointment with the Oakhurst Sheriff's office to submit your form. _(Very important!)_
   3. Bring _the 1st page of your form_ and
      [a current, valid photo ID](https://oag.ca.gov/fingerprints/locations)
      to your appointment. You will be fingerprinted and your identity will be verified when
      they complete your form and submit it.
   4. Submission is under $10 for coaches, but only at the Oakhurst Sheriff's office.

Who needs to submit a Live Scan?
From [California Assembly Bill No. 506](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB506){:target="_blank"}:
> "Regular volunteer" means a volunteer with the youth service
> organization who is 18 years of age or older and who has direct
> contact with, or supervision of, children for more than 16 hours
> per month or 32 hours per year.
{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice--info">{{ regular-volunteers | markdownify }}</div>

For us, this includes coaches and assistant coaches -- anybody who will regularly help at
practices or be on the field during games.

{: .notice--warning }
A Live Scan for another organization cannot be used by MY Club.
