## Requirement Details

### Sign Up: Sports Connect

See the
[Volunteer](https://www.sierramountainll.com/Default.aspx?tabid=716513&familyid=1280771057954850150&subctl=volunteersinfo){:target="_blank"}
section in Sports Connect and **sign up for a position** there.

That page has a place to upload your ID and some other clearances,
like a certificate from SafeSport and a few others. When you have those done,
you'll need to return to this page to upload the files or images so we can check them.

### Background Check: JDP

Any volunteer who provides "regular service to the league or repetitive access
to children" must go through the background check process. That includes helping
with hitting and catching during practice, coaching a base or coordinating
the batting lineup during games, even working in the snack bar or being a team
parent. Please see Little League's [Background Checks for Little League®
Volunteers](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/background-checks-for-little-league-volunteers/) for more info.

In order to be in compliance with [California's Business & Professions Code
§ 18900](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&sectionNum=18900.), Sierra Mountain Little League submits all volunteers to a background check
and provides them with SafeSport-approved abuse training annually. This is required
of all volunteers, regardless of whether an individual is new to the program or
returning.

A background check is performed at the beginning of each season, with enhanced screening
at J.D. Palatine (JDP). This includes:

> the JDP National Criminal Search, plus Developed names, and collects
> data from more than 685 million criminal records, sex offender
> registries in 50 states, OFAC, FBI Terrorist List, Proprietary
> Offender Data, Department of Public Safety, Administrative Office
> of the Courts, Department of Corrections, Federal/State/Local wanted
> fugitive lists, as well as searches of the SafeSport Centralized
> Disciplinary Database and Little League International
> Ineligible/Suspended List.

### Abuse Awareness: SafeSport

As of 2024, Little League International requires annual abuse awareness training.
Sierra Mountain Little League offers SafeSport-compliant training through Little League's
[Base Abuse Awareness](https://www.littleleague.org/player-safety/child-protection-program/safesport-resources-parents/) program.

To meet California's requirements, complete USA Baseball's
[Abuse Awareness for Adults course](https://usabdevelops.com/page/3532/courses?page=1&TAG_ID=2188).
More info is available at [USA Baseball's Baseball Athlete Safety Education
page](https://usabdevelops.com/page/4834/base/17090/base).

If you need to register for a new account, note that "Sierra Mountain
Little League" is not listed under "Little League - Local Leagues".
Select "\*\* Little League", then click "+ Join" instead.

{: .notice--success }
If you've already completed a SafeSport Abuse Awareness training program for another sport
or league and your certificate is still current, you can use it for Little League, too.
For example, [US Soccer's SafeSport program](https://learning.ussoccer.com/coach/courses/available/29/details/5606) is adequate for our needs. Just upload the certificate to your Sports Connect volunteer page.

First aid and fundamental baseball training are Little League requirements.


### Fingerprinting: Live Scans

_Coming Soon!_

<!--
5. Register a **Live Scan**. This only needs to be done once by each league
   manager and coach and does not need to be done annually. A Live Scan for
   another organization cannot be used by SMLL.

**Please Note**:
For registrations, it is essential that you use your full legal name. The system that
processes your Live Scan application will only be able to connect your information
to our registration system if they all have the same name. The Live Scan application
runs through the California Department of Justice, where it will need to match your
registered legal name.
