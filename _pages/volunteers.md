## Requirement Details

### Sign Up

#### Volunteer in Sports Connect

See the
[Volunteer](https://www.sierramountainll.com/Default.aspx?tabid=716513&familyid=1280771057954850150&subctl=volunteersinfo){:target="_blank"}
section in Sports Connect and **sign up for a position** there.

That page has a place to upload your ID and some other clearances,
like a certificate from SafeSport and a few others. When you have those done,
you'll need to return to the Volunteer page to upload those files or images
so we can check them.

#### Sign Up for NFHS Learn

NFHS is the easiest place to take free courses that will keep all of us in compliance with California & Federal law.

You can register for an
[NFHS Learn Account](https://accounts.nfhs.org/users/sign_up?redirect_to=https://nfhslearn.com/users/auth/openid_connect){:target="_blank"}
to take your abuse awareness, concussion, and sudden cardiac arrest training.
Those are suitable for coaches across our age divisions, from tee ball through high school.


### Courses

#### Abuse Awareness

The federal Safe Sport Act and California AB 506 require abuse prevention training. To statisfy those,
you can take these courses:

- [NFHS Learn's Protecting Students from Abuse](https://nfhslearn.com/courses/protecting-students-from-abuse){:target="_blank"}
- [CDSS Mandated Reporter Training](https://account.mandatedreportertraining.com/join-org?GUID=15ac88df-a860-ef11-bdfd-6045bd058c56){:target="_blank"}

{: .notice--success }
If you've already completed an AB 506-compliant abuse awareness training program for another sport
or league and your certificate is still current, you can use it for MY Club, too.  For example,
[US Soccer's SafeSport program](https://learning.ussoccer.com/coach/courses/available/29/details/5606)
is adequate for our needs. Just upload the certificate to your Sports Connect volunteer page.

For more info, see the California Dept of Social Services page on
[Mandated Reporter Training](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/ocap/mrt)

#### Cardiac Arrest

[Sudden Cardiac Arrest training](https://epsavealife.org/sca-prevention-training/){:target="_blank"}
training is [required by California
law](https://www.littleleague.org/player-safety/state-laws-on-sudden-cardiac-arrest-training/){:target="_blank"}
for coaches in educational sports programs. To satisfy this, you can take this free course:

> **[NFHS Learn: Sudden Cardiac Arrest Training](https://nfhslearn.com/courses/sudden-cardiac-arrest){:target="_blank"}**

{: .notice--success }
According to
([AB 379 § 2.124235(a)(5)(A)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB379),
coaches and other administrators need to take the course "at least once", and we need to offer it annually.

{: .notice--info }
Coaches of youth sports programs are encouraged to follow the guidelines of 
the The Eric Paredes Sudden Cardiac Prevention Act
[Dept of Ed Article 13 § 33479.8](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=EDC&sectionNum=33479.8.){:target="_blank"}

#### Concussion

[HEADS UP concussion training](https://www.cdc.gov/heads-up/training/youth-sports.html){:target="_blank"}
is [required by California law](https://www.littleleague.org/player-safety/concussions-youth-athletes/){:target="_blank"}
for any coach working in a youth sport. To satisfy this, you can take this free course:

> **[NFHS Learn: Concussion Training](https://nfhslearn.com/courses/concussion-in-sports-2){:target="_blank"}**

{: .notice--success }
According to
[AB 2007](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB2007#:~:text=The%20bill%20would%20require%20youth,organization%2C%20irrespective%20of%20their%20ages.),
coaches need to take the course "at least once". After you've done this, you don't need to repeat it,
but it is good info to keep fresh.


### Fingerprinting: Live Scans

A Live Scan[^notice] must be done specifically for MY Club by each coach or other
"regular volunteer". Thankfully, you only need to do it once, It _does not_ need to be
done annually.  rather than annually like the rest of the certs. Unfortunately, though,
a Live Scan for another organization can't be used for MY Club.

   1. Fill out the [MY Club Live Scan form]({% link /assets/files/myclub-livescan-2026.pdf %}).
      Use your full legal name, as found on your driver's license or California ID.
   2. Make an appointment with the Oakhurst Sheriff's office to submit your form. _(Very important!)_
   3. Bring _the 1st page of your form_ and
      [a current, valid photo ID](https://oag.ca.gov/fingerprints/locations)
      to your appointment. You will be fingerprinted and your identity will be verified when
      they complete your form and submit it.
   4. Submission $10-25 for coaches, but only at the Oakhurst Sheriff's office. Let them know you're
      coming from SMLL and they may give you a better rate.


{% capture regular-volunteers %}
Who needs to submit a Live Scan?
From [California Assembly Bill No. 506](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB506){:target="_blank"}:
> "Regular volunteer" means a volunteer with the youth service
> organization who is 18 years of age or older and who has direct
> contact with, or supervision of, children for more than 16 hours
> per month or 32 hours per year.
{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice--info">{{ regular-volunteers | markdownify }}</div>

For us, this includes coaches and assistant coaches -- anybody who will regularly help at
practices or be on the field during games.

{: .notice--warning }
A Live Scan for another organization cannot be used by MY Club.
