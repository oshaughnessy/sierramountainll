## Requirement Details

### Sign Up: Sports Connect

See the
[Volunteer](https://www.sierramountainll.com/Default.aspx?tabid=716513&familyid=1280771057954850150&subctl=volunteersinfo){:target="_blank"}
section in Sports Connect and **sign up for a position** there.

That page has a place to upload your ID and some other clearances,
like a certificate from SafeSport and a few others. When you have those done,
you'll need to return to the Volunteer page to upload those files or images
so we can check them.

### Background Check: JDP

Any volunteer who provides "regular service to the league or repetitive access
to children" must go through the background check process.

{: .notice--warning }
This includes helping with hitting and catching during practice,
coaching a base or being in the dugout during games, even working
in the snack bar or being a team parent. Please see Little League's
[Background Checks for Little League®
Volunteers](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/background-checks-for-little-league-volunteers/) for more info.

In order to be in compliance with [California's Business & Professions Code
§ 18900](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&sectionNum=18900.), Sierra Mountain Little League submits all volunteers to a background check
and provides them with SafeSport-approved abuse training annually. This is required
of all volunteers, regardless of whether an individual is new to the program or
returning.

A background check is performed at the beginning of each season,
with enhanced screening at J.D. Palatine (JDP). This includes:

> the JDP National Criminal Search, plus Developed names, and collects
> data from more than 685 million criminal records, sex offender
> registries in 50 states, OFAC, FBI Terrorist List, Proprietary
> Offender Data, Department of Public Safety, Administrative Office
> of the Courts, Department of Corrections, Federal/State/Local wanted
> fugitive lists, as well as searches of the SafeSport Centralized
> Disciplinary Database and Little League International
> Ineligible/Suspended List.

following locations:

### Abuse Awareness: Little League

Little League International requires annual abuse awareness training through
[Little League's Abuse Awareness](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/abuse-awareness-training-course/)
course.

{: .notice--info }
In prior years, USA Baseball's 
[Abuse Awareness for Adults course](https://usabdevelops.com/page/3532/courses?page=1&TAG_ID=2188) or
another sport program's SafeSport-compliant certification was adequate. These options were retired
beginning with the 2025 season.

{: .notice--success }
If you need to register for a new account in the LL training portal, to find our league,
search for "Sierra Mountain" and click on "SIERRA MOUNTAIN LL".

For more information, see Little League's
[SafeSport Resources for Leagues](https://www.littleleague.org/player-safety/child-protection-program/safesport-resources-parents/) program.

### Fingerprinting: Live Scans

A Live Scan must be done specifically for SMLL by each coach or other
"regular volunteer". It _does not_ need to be done annually.

{% capture regular-volunteers %}
Who needs to submit a Live Scan?
From [California Assembly Bill No. 506](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB506){:target="_blank"}:
> "Regular volunteer" means a volunteer with the youth service
> organization who is 18 years of age or older and who has direct
> contact with, or supervision of, children for more than 16 hours
> per month or 32 hours per year.
{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice--info">{{ regular-volunteers | markdownify }}</div>

For us, this primarily includes coaches and team parents.

{: .notice--warning }
A Live Scan for another organization cannot be used by SMLL.
