## Background Checks

Little League International (LLI) requires its leagues to perform background checks on
all individuals with "regular, repetitive access to players".

In order to be in compliance with [California's Business & Professions Code
ยง 18900](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&sectionNum=18900.), Sierra Mountain Little League submits all volunteers to a background check
and provides them with Safe Sport-approved abuse training annually. This is required
of all volunteers, regardless of whether an individual is new to the program or
returning.

A background check is performed at the beginning of each season, with enhanced screening
at J.D. Palatine (JDP). This includes:

> the JDP National Criminal Search, plus Developed names, and collects
> data from more than 685 million criminal records, sex offender
> registries in 50 states, OFAC, FBI Terrorist List, Proprietary
> Offender Data, Department of Public Safety, Administrative Office
> of the Courts, Department of Corrections, Federal/State/Local wanted
> fugitive lists, as well as searches of the SafeSport Centralized
> Disciplinary Database and Little League International
> Ineligible/Suspended List.
