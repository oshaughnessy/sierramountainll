Thanks for looking into volunteering with Sierra Mountain Little League!

We have a handful of requirements for everyone who spends time with our players.
These are mandated by the state, the federal government, and Little League.

## Summary

Any volunteer who provides "regular service to the league or repetitive access
to children" must go through the background check process. That includes helping
with hitting and catching during practice, coaching a base or coordinating
the batting lineup during games, even working in the snack bar or being a team
parent. Please see Little League's [Background Checks for Little League®
Volunteers](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/background-checks-for-little-league-volunteers/) for more info.

1. First, see the [Volunteer](https://www.sierramountainll.com/Default.aspx?tabid=716513&familyid=1280771057954850150&subctl=volunteersinfo){:target="_blank"}
    section in Sports Connect and **sign up for a position** there.

2. Be aware that all volunteers who spend significant time with kids
   must go through a **background check**. The league will submit this
   for you using your registration info. See "Background Checks" below.

3. Complete USA Baseball's [Abuse Awareness for Adults at usabdevelops.com](https://usabdevelops.com/page/3532/courses?page=1&TAG_ID=2188). If you need to register for a new account, note that "Sierra Mountain
   Little League" is not listed under "Little League - Local Leagues".
   Select "\*\* Little League", then click "+ Join" instead.

   If you've already completed a Safe Sport Abuse Awareness training program for another sport
   or league and your certificate is still current, you can use it for Little League, too.
   For example, [US Soccer's SafeSport program](https://learning.ussoccer.com/coach/courses/available/29/details/5606) is adequate for our needs.

### If you're a manager or coach...

4. Complete the **coaching courses**:
     * [Concussion training](https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/youthsports/training/index.html){:target="_blank"} is
       annual training [required by California law](https://www.littleleague.org/player-safety/concussions-youth-athletes/){:target="_blank"} for any coach working in a youth sport.
     * Please see the other [**coaching courses**]({{ site.baseurl }}/coaches/#what-do-i-need-to-be-a-coach).
       First aid and fundamental baseball training are Little League requirements.

<!--
5. Register a **Live Scan**. This only needs to be done once by each league
   manager and coach and does not need to be done annually. A Live Scan for
   another organization cannot be used by SMLL.

**Please Note**:
For registrations, it is essential that you use your full legal name. The system that
processes your Live Scan application will only be able to connect your information
to our registration system if they all have the same name. The Live Scan application
runs through the California Department of Justice, where it will need to match your
registered legal name.

## Background Checks

Little League International (LLI) requires its leagues to perform background checks on
all individuals with "regular, repetitive access to players".

In order to be in compliance with [California's Business & Professions Code
§ 18900](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&sectionNum=18900.), Sierra Mountain Little League submits all volunteers to a background check
and provides them with Safe Sport-approved abuse training annually. This is required
of all volunteers, regardless of whether an individual is new to the program or
returning.

A background check is performed at the beginning of each season, with enhanced screening
at J.D. Palatine (JDP). This includes:

> the JDP National Criminal Search, plus Developed names, and collects
> data from more than 685 million criminal records, sex offender
> registries in 50 states, OFAC, FBI Terrorist List, Proprietary
> Offender Data, Department of Public Safety, Administrative Office
> of the Courts, Department of Corrections, Federal/State/Local wanted
> fugitive lists, as well as searches of the SafeSport Centralized
> Disciplinary Database and Little League International
> Ineligible/Suspended List.

## Abuse Awareness

As of 2024, Little League International requires annual abuse awareness training.
Sierra Mountain Little League offers Safe Sport-compliant training through Little League's
[Base Abuse Awareness](https://www.littleleague.org/player-safety/child-protection-program/safesport-resources-parents/) program.

More information on the BASE program and training available can be found at
[USA Baseball's Baseball Athlete Safety Education
page](https://usabdevelops.com/page/4834/base/17090/base).

Courses provided to volunteers include [Abuse Awareness for Adults at usabdevelops.com](https://usabdevelops.com/page/3532/courses).

If you have completed a Safe Sport training program for another organization
and have an active certificate of completion, you can use that for Little League.
Just upload the certificate to your Sports Connect volunteer page.
