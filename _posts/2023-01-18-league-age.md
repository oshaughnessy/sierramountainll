How does your player's age affect the division they'll be in?
It's a key way to identify the starting point for players in
the league.

It's not always the only factor, though -- you can see that
there's some overlap in the groups below.  Players who want
to play in AAA and above will need to attend an assessment.
One or more are offered before every season begins.

SMLL has established the following age groups:

## <span class="baseball">Baseball</span>
{: .baseball }

A player's "league age" for baseball is the age they will be by the end of August 31
in the current season's year.

| Division                | Age Range
|-------------------------|---------------------
| TeeBall                 | 4-5 years old
| Minors/Coach Pitch      | 5-6 years old
| Minors/Player Pitch     | 7-8 years old
| AAA                     | 8-10 years old[^1]
| Majors                  | 10-12 years old[^1]
| 50/70                   | 11-13 years old[^1]
| Challenger              | 4-18

## <span class="softball">Softball</span>
{: .softball}

A player's "league age" for softball is the age they were at the end of the 
year preceding the season.

| Division                | Age Range
|-------------------------|---------------------
| Minors                  | 5-11[^1]
| Majors                  | 9-12[^1]


## League Age

We use the league age to fit players into the categories above. Note that the
formula for baseball and softball is different.

See the [Little League age calculator](https://www.littleleague.org/play-little-league/determine-league-age/){:target="_blank"}
for more information.
