We've established our assessment dates for the 2023 season:

	Feb 27: 8 & 9-year-olds
	Feb 28: 10 & 11-year-olds
	Mar 1: 12 & 13-year-olds
	Mar 2: All softball

We'll meet at 6pm at the [Sierra Mountain Little League fields]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact#fields)
on each of these nights.

All players must attend an assessment in order to be placed on a team. We use
this time to see what skill level our incoming players have, then use that to
create balanced teams and ensure a fun and safe season for everyone.

If you have any questions, please [reach out to us]({% link _pages/contact.md %}) through email
or Facebook. If you're not sure of the league age of your players, please see our
[League Age & Divisions]({% post_url 2023-01-18-league-age %}) post.

See you on the field!
