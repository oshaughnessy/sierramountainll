New assessment dates have been set! We found a place to hold them indoors.

We'll meet at the Oak Creek Elementary school's baseball field if the weather
allows it, or the gymnasium otherwise, on March 26.

	12pm: 8 & 9-year-olds
	1pm: softball parent meeting
	2pm: 10 & 11-year-olds
	4pm: 12 & 13-year-olds

All players 8 and up are asked to attend. For each age group, softball players
will go first, then baseball players.

If you have any questions, please [reach out to us]({% link _pages/contact.md %})
through email or Facebook. If you're not sure of the league age of your players,
please see our [League Age & Divisions]({% post_url 2023-01-18-league-age %}) post.

See you at OCI!
