## Evaluations

Our player evaluations will be on **Saturday, Feb 24** at the
[SMLL fields]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact#fields).

We'll include all leagues:
<span class=baseball>baseball</span>,
<span class=softball>softball</span>, and
<span class=challenger>Challenger</span>.
Times for age ranges will be posted soon.

All players 7 and up are asked to attend (only those playing in
a Major or Junior league are required to). We use this time to see what skill
level our incoming players have, then use that to create balanced
teams and ensure a fun and safe season for everyone.

If you have any questions, please [reach out to us]({% link _pages/contact.md %})
through email or Facebook. If you're not sure of the league age of your players,
please see our [League Age & Divisions]({% post_url 2023-01-18-league-age %}) post.


## Field Repair Day

We're doing a field repair day at SMLL on **Saturday, March 16**.
Last year we had dozens and dozens of people show up to do spring cleaning
at the fields & walkways, dugout repairs, painting... so many things. It was such
a success and such a fun day seeing so many people help out. Let's do the same
this year and get those facilities safe and ready to have fun with as soon as
the weather starts turning good!



## Season Start

If the weather this winter cooperates, we'll start the 2024 season with games on
**Saturday, March 30**.

Looking forward to seeing all of you on the field!
