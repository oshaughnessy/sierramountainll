## Assessments

Our player assessments will be on **Saturday, Feb 24** at the
[SMLL fields]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact#fields).

We'll include all leagues:
<span class=baseball>baseball</span>,
<span class=softball>softball</span>, and
<span class=challenger>Challenger</span>.
Times for age ranges will be posted soon.

All players 7 and up are asked to attend (only those playing in
a Major or Junior league are required to). We use this time to see what skill
level our incoming players have, then use that to create balanced
teams and ensure a fun and safe season for everyone.

If you have any questions, please [reach out to us]({% link _pages/contact.md %})
through email or Facebook. If you're not sure of the league age of your players,
please see our [League Age & Divisions]({% post_url 2023-01-18-league-age %}) post.


## Season Start

If the weather this winter cooperates, we'll start the 2024 season with games on
**Saturday, March 16**.

Looking forward to seeing all of you on the field!
