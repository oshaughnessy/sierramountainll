Hi, SMLL families! A coach from one of our neighbor leagues in
Merced reached out to find some active minor-division players,
and we're spreading the word.

Will Atkinson at SP Elite is looking for around 5 players, ages 9-10,
for a fall baseball team to play in late August through October.

Games would primarily be in Merced on Saturdays, plus a few weekday games.
 
The cost per player will be $150 or less (depending on sponsors).

_If you're interested, please reach out to Will at 209-628-5679._

See [spelitesports.org](https://spelitesports.org) for more info about the league.
