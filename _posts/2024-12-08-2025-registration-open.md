Wondering what division to sign up for? After you log in to the registration site
and fill out your child's basic information, you'll be offered appropriate choices
for them. Our [League Age &amp; Divisions post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/01/18/league-age/)
gives a short overview of how we separate age groups into divisions here at SMLL.
