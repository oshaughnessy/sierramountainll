In brief: 

- Mar 1: spring cleaning
- Mar 8: tryouts
- Mar 29: opening day


## Spring Cleaning Day

We're doing a field repair day at SMLL on **Saturday, March 1**.

In the past, we've used this time to refresh everything in the snack shack,
clean fields & walkways, perform dugout repairs, fix the wheels on our chalkers,
lube up the mower, repaint wherever needed. This day is really important to get
us ready for a safe, fun, and productive spring season.


## Assessments

Our player evaluations will be on **Saturday, March 8** at the
[SMLL fields]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact#fields).

We'll include all leagues:
<span class=baseball>baseball</span>,
<span class=softball>softball</span>, and
<span class=challenger>Challenger</span>.
Times for age ranges will be posted soon.

All baseball players 7 and up are asked to attend (only those playing in
a Major or Junior league are required to).

All softball players, regardless of age, are asked to come.

We use this time to see what skill level our incoming players have, then use
that to create balanced teams and ensure a fun and safe season for everyone.

If you have any questions, please [reach out to us]({% link _pages/contact.md %})
through email or Facebook. If you're not sure of the league age of your players,
please see our [League Age & Divisions]({% post_url 2023-01-18-league-age %}) post.


## Season Start

If the weather this winter cooperates, we'll start the 2025 season with games on
**Saturday, March 29**.


Looking forward to seeing everyone on the fields!
