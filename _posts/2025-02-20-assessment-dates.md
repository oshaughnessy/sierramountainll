Player assessments for the 2025 season will be:

Baseball
* 10am: 8-9yo
* 12pm: 10-11yo
* 2pm: 12+

Softball
* 10am: 6-8yo
* 12pm: 9-11yo
* 2pm: 12+

All players 8 and above must attend an evaluation in order to be placed on a team.
We use this time to see what skill level our incoming players have, then use that
to create balanced teams and ensure a fun and safe season for everyone.

In addition, if any 6-year-old girls would like to join our 8U softball
division, we ask that they come to our 10am tryouts so they can show the coaches
they're ready to join the older players.  Otherwise, we can welcome all of our
6-year-olds in tee ball or coach pitch baseball.

We'll meet at the [Sierra Mountain Little League fields]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact#fields).

If you have any questions, please [reach out to us]({% link _pages/contact.md %})
through email or Facebook. If you're not sure of the league age of your players,
please see our [League Age & Divisions]({% post_url 2023-01-18-league-age %}) post.

See you on the field!
