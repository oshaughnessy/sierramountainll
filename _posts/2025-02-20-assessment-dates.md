Baseball and softball player assessments for the 2025 season will be:

* ~~10am: 8 & 9-year-olds~~
* ~~12pm: 10 & 11-year-olds~~
* ~~2pm: 12 & older~~

We'll meet at the [Sierra Mountain Little League fields]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact#fields).

All players must attend an evaluation in order to be placed on a team. We use
this time to see what skill level our incoming players have, then use that to
create balanced teams and ensure a fun and safe season for everyone.

If you have any questions, please [reach out to us]({% link _pages/contact.md %})
through email or Facebook. If you're not sure of the league age of your players,
please see our [League Age & Divisions]({% post_url 2023-01-18-league-age %}) post.

See you on the field!
