With the move to MY Club, we've been able to lower our rates this year!

- [Challenger baseball]({% link _pages/challenger.md %}) is still free<br />
- Tee ball is **$65**, down from $100<br />
- All other divisions are **$85**, down from $125 or $150<br />
  <small>coach & player pitch baseball; 6U & 8U fastpitch</small><br />
  <small>AAA, Majors, 50/70 baseball; 10U, 12U, 14U fastpitch</small><br />

Wondering what division to sign up for? After you fill out your player's basic info, you'll only
see age-appropriate choices for them.

Our [League Age &amp; Divisions post]({% post_url 2023-01-18-league-age %}) gives a short overview
of how we break out age groups here at SMLL.
